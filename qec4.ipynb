    "# Quantum Error Correction for Dummies (QEC4D)\n",
    "# Chapter IV - Stabilisers\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0) Overview\n",
    "The stabilisers of a state are a group of operators which, when applied to said state, leave it unchanged. The idea behind this is that we can therefore define a state or space entirely based on its stabilisers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0-A) A geometric intuition for the stabilisers' interest\n",
    "For an intuition on how and why we would describe a space based on its stabilisers, let's look at a simple example involving basic geometrical shapes.\n",
    "Imagine we were to encxode information using geometric shapes, and errors would be deformations causing a shape to transform into another.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we would pick 2 shapes to be used as our basic symbols for encoding. For our example, we'll pick squares and octagons.\n",
    "Now let's consider that there are 2 types of errors, one that deforms a square or an octagon into an equilateral triangle and one that deforms them into an hexagon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's imagine that I create a symbol (square or octagon) and stick it into a black box without telling you what they are. From there, you are supposed to discover what the word is only by making tests that would leave the correct word unchanged. Sounds hard? There's 2 tricks to it. The questions you want to ask must:\n",
    "1. Have a \"yes\" answer for both correct symbols (square, octagon) but a \"no\" answer for at least one of the incorrect symbols.\n",
    "2. You want to ask questions to which one of the errors would answer \"yes\" and the other would answer \"no\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Finding the right questions to ask\n",
    "What questions do we have that have a *yes* answer for correct symbols? In other words, which geometrical properties are shared by both, the square and the octagon?\n",
    "- Rotation by 90° gives back the same shape.\n",
    "- Reflexion along the horizontal axis gives back the same shape.\n",
    "- Reflexion along the vertical axis gives back the same shape.\n",
    "All of these are true for both, the square and the octagon. We say that these properties ***stabilise*** the square and the octagon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now how about the errors? Let's agree that we set our shapes with the a flat side as base.\n",
    "- *Rotation by 90° gives back the same shape.* This is false for the equilateral triangle and for the hexagon. We say that this propertie ***does not stabilise*** the equilateral triangle or the hexagon.\n",
    "- *Reflexion along the horizontal axis gives back the same shape.* This is false for the equilateral triangle but true for the hexagon. This property ***stabilises*** the hexagon but ***does not stabilise*** the equilateral triangle.\n",
    "- *Reflexion along the vertical axis gives back the same shape.* This is true for both the equilateral triangle and the hexagon, they are both ***stabilised*** by this property.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Asking the questions\n",
    "I now claim that by asking sequentially 2 questions, I am completely able to determine which error has occured. How?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If I reflect along the horizontal axis, do I get back the same shape?\n",
    "I will here get a *yes* answer for any shape except the equilateral triangle. If I get a *no* here, I know I have the equilateral triangle and that's it. But if I don't, it can either be no error or the error that turns shapes into hexagons. Therefore I need to ask one more question.\n",
    "2. If I rotate the shape clock-wise by 90°, do I get back the same shape? If the answer is yes, it means that no error occurred. If the answer is no, I need to remember the answer to the first question. If it was \"yes\", then the error that occurred is an hexagon transformnation. If it was \"no\", then it is indeed the equilateral triangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that here, I have obtained all the information I needed only by asking questions that leave the correct symbols untouched. This is the core idea behind *stabilisers*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) The importance of commutation\n",
    "One last property that stabilisers must have, is that they must ***commute*** with each other. In simple terms, this means that if I have 2 stabilisers A and B, applying A first then B should give me the same result as applying B first then A.\n",
    "To keep our example with geometrical shapes, this means that :\n",
    "1. First reflecting along the horizontal axis,\n",
    "2. then rotating the shape clock-wise by 90°\n",
    "Must give the same result on our shapes of interest (square and octagon) as\n",
    "1. First rotating the shape by 90° clock-wise\n",
    "2. then reflecting along the horizontal axis\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily this is true for our example.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about other shapes? This can't always be true!\n",
    "Correct! And it doesn't need to be. Stabilisers are defined for a particular *thing* (called the ***code subspace***). It means that if I have my stabiliser for my specific *thing* called $\\mathcal{C}$, then they must always commute for any element of $\\mathcal{C}$. But I don't need to guarantee that this is true for elements outside of $\\mathcal{C}$! So, can you find elements outside of your code subspace $\\mathcal{C}$ on which stabilisers don't commute? Absolutely. And that's ok. For instance a rhombus or a parallelogram would be examples of shapes on which our stabiliser doesn't commute. But that's perfectly fine since they are not part of our code subspace."
